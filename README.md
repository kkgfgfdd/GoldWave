 ## Features of GoldWave Full:

Remastering. Remaster old vinyl or tape recordings. Use Noise Reduction and Pop/Click filters to clean up the audio and take out the buzz, hiss, crackle, and clicks. Use the Spectrum Filter for precise control over frequency and tone. Remove offsets and long silences.

Analyze. Analyze audio with frequency and amplitude visuals. View spectrograms, bar graphs, waveforms, level meters, and other useful graphs. Instantly see any audio problems during recording and playback. Isolate that high pitch whine or low rumble by sight, making filtering much easier. Demonstrate engineering and mathematical concepts, such as filters, Fourier transforms, and signal processing. Analyze human speech, bird song, whale song, engine noise, and other interesting sounds.

Playing. Play all your favorite songs and view real-time visuals. Listen to the audio while fast-forwarding or rewinding. Change the playback speed to hear your music in a whole new way, learn a song by ear, or transcribe dictation or a lesson.

Recording. Record any source your computer supports, including microphone, line-in, and what-you-hear. Connect a turntable to record LPs, a cassette deck to record tapes, a receiver to record radio, or a microphone to record your music, speeches, or reports. Use the timer to start recording at a certain day and time. Use level-activated recording to continue and pause recording automatically whenever the signal is above or below a given level.
